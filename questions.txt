1. What is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis?
es una enfermedad
It is a disease

2. According to its man page, what does getrusage do?

mide el tiempo guardando entre las variables antes y despues 
Measure time by saving between before and after variables

3. Per that same man page, how many members are in a variable of type struct rusage?

dos: antes y despues
Two before and after

4. Why do you think we pass before and after by reference (instead of by value) to calculate, even though we’re not changing their contents?
la estructura de antes y despues tienen varios datos integrados, se facilita pasar por referencia.

The before and after structure have various integrated data, it is easy to pass by reference

5. Explain as precisely as possible, in a paragraph or more, how main goes about reading words from a file. In other words, convince us that you indeed understand how that function’s for loop works.

se debe leer y almacenar cada cada renglon hasta que se encuentra \n 
 
se debe hacerlo anterior repetidamente hasta que se encuentra EOF 

You must read and store each line until it is \ n

It must be done before repeatedly until EOF is found



6. Why do you think we used fgetc to read each word’s characters one at a time rather than use fscanf with a format string like "%s" to read whole words at a time? Put another way, what problems might arise by relying on fscanf alone?

fget.s almacena hasta el salto de linea pero scanf aunque puede leer hasta el salto de linea no lo almacena 

fgets hace más compacto el código

Fget.s stores until the line break but scanf although it can read until the line break does not store it

Fgets makes the code more compact

7. Why do you think we declared the parameters for check and load as const?

se asegura de no cambiar nada en las estructuras

Make sure you do not change anything in the structures
